# NotesApp

A material design notes app which packs a small amount of, but essential features.

# Recommended installation

1. Download the latest version of executable (exe) from [github releases page](https://github.com/ShouLie/NotesApp/releases).
2. Move it to C:\Program Files\NotesApp (To keep generated files out of your workspace)
3. Send a shortcut to the desktop.

# Features

* Basic features: Creating and managing your notes. 📝
* Notes are stored as SQLite database files, therefore it is easy to back up. 🗄️
* Notes can be exported from the app as separate text files, or a single zip archive. ↗️
* Dark and light mode support 🌙
* Built-in cipher (Encrypt notes with AES) 🔐
* **I'm planning on adding extra features and improving existing ones in the future (see Roadmap).**
